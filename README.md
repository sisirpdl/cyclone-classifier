# Cyclone Classifier
The cyclones are irregular wind movements involving closed air circulation around a low pressure centre. This closed air circulation is caused by atmospheric disturbances over and above the earth’s surface, coupled with the earth’s ‘rotation which imparts to these disturbances a whirling motion.
In short, this project is about Image Based Cyclone Speed Prediction by retraining Pretrained Architecture and countermeasure generation based on speed based cyclone categorization.
