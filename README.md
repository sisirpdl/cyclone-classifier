# Cyclone Classifier
The cyclones are irregular wind movements involving closed air circulation around a low pressure centre. This closed air circulation is caused by atmospheric disturbances over and above the earth’s surface, coupled with the earth’s ‘rotation which imparts to these disturbances a whirling motion.

## About the Project
* **Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, PyTorch, TorchVision, Geocoder, OpenWeatherMap API

* **Objective:** Image Based Cyclone Speed Prediction by retraining Pretrained Architecture and countermeasure generation based on speed based cyclone categorization.

## How to run the Project:-

1. **Install python version 3.7.9 on your computer**

2. **Clone the repo.**
```
git clone https://github.com/The-Knots/The-Knots.git
```
3. **Navigate to Repo Directory**
``` 
cd The-Knots
```
4. **Download Package Dependancies**
make sure python3.7.9 is activated.
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run app.py**
Check if python3.7.9 is activated/not.
``` 
python app.py
```
